## Installation 
   
   There are two ways of installing the library for Pepipost either you can use 
   
   ```pip install pepipost``` 
   
   **OR**
   
   ```git clone https://github.com/pepipost/pepipost-python.git``` 
   
   Below are the steps inorder to install the library
   
### Prerequisites
   * Python (2 >=2.7.9 or 3 >= 3.4)
   1. Python IDE (we are using [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) )
   2. Python packages  
      * nose
      * jsonpickle
   
      **OR**
   
   1. [Pepipost package]()
   
   Installation of PIP can be done from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
   
   We recommend using PIP Dependency manager in order to install all the dependencies which we had mentioned in ```requirements.txt``` files that comes in SDK.
   
   
### Defining Enviroment variable.   
   
   * Python and PIP Should be defined in your PATH.
   * Check using 
   
     ```pip --version```   --> Will display the version of PIP dependency manager installed.

     ```python --version```  --> Will Display the Version of Python installed which should be >=2.7.1 if you are using 2 else it can be >=3.4 if you are using python 3.

### Quickstart

   1. Using SDK from Github repository, Run the below command to download the requirements
         
      ```pip install -r requirement.txt```
      
      ![Building SDK - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=installDependencies&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Python)
      
      **OR**

      Using PIP dependency manager download our official library directly from PIP 
      
      Run below Command inorder to download Pepipost library.
      
      ```pip install pepipost```

   2. Open Project in an IDE
   
      Open up a Python IDE like PyCharm. 
      The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.
      
      ![Open project in PyCharm - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=pyCharm)
      
      Click on ```Open``` in PyCharm to browse to your generated SDK directory and then
      
      click ```OK```

      ![Open project in PyCharm - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=openProject0&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Python)     

      The project files will be displayed in the side bar as follows:

      ![Open project in PyCharm - Step 3](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=openProject1&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Python&projectName=pepipost)     

   3. Add a new Test Project

      Create a new directory by right clicking on the solution name as shown below:

      ![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=createDirectory&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Python&projectName=pepipost)

      Name the directory as "test"

      ![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=nameDirectory)
   
      Add a python file to this project with the name "testsdk"

      ![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 3](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=createFile&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Python&projectName=pepipost)

      Name it "testsdk"

      ![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=nameFile)

   4. Importing files from python library

      Inorder to import file you need to just copy the [sample file from here](#sample). 

      ![Add a new project in PyCharm - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=projectFiles&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Python&libraryName=pepipost.pepipost_client&projectName=pepipost&className=PepipostClient)

   5. Update API key and Sending Domain
   
      * apikey: This will be available under: Login to your Pepipost account -> Settings -> Integration.
      
      * FromEmail: If your fromemail address is e.g. info@mydomain.com, then the Sending Domain mydomain need to be verified and active under your Pepipost account. You can manage the Sending Domain under: Login to Pepipost -> Settings -> Sending Domains.
      
   6. Run the Test Project
   
      To run the file 
      
      ```ctrl+F5```
      
      **OR** 
      
      Right click on your Python file inside your Test project and click on ```Run```

      ![Run Test Project - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/python?step=runProject&workspaceFolder=pepipost-Python&libraryName=pepipost.pepipost_client&projectName=pepipost&className=PepipostClient)

body.settings = Settings()

body.settings.footer = 1
body.settings.clicktrack = 1
body.settings.opentrack = 1
body.settings.unsubscribe = 1

try:
    result = email_controller.create_send_email(api_key, body)
    if not (result.error_info.error_message is None):
        print("Reason :: " + str(result.error_info.error_message) + "\n" + "Message :: " + str(result.message))
    else:
        print("Message :: " + result.message)
except APIException as e:
    print(e)
